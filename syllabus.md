## About This Course

Unlike Math, English, or History, this class is not required for you to graduate. It's a Career Technical Education (CTE) class, and it is a privilege to be able to take it. As such, students will be held to a higher standard. As a CTE class, this course is designed to prepare students for a career. Students will be given responsibilities, and will be expected to complete those tasks. If they have questions or are unable to complete a task, they are expected to reach out for help, as they would at a real job.
